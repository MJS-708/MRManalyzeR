# MRManalyzeR

Reproducible post-acquisition processing of targeted LC-MS/MS metabolomics
and lipidomics results exported from Waters TargetLynx or Skyline. It reads
the quantitative result tables, integrates them with sample and feature
metadata, applies configurable quality-control and matrix-processing steps,
and returns an analysis-ready `struct::DatasetExperiment` together with
self-contained data-quality and statistical reports.

Each processing and analysis step is available as an exported R function
operating on that object. Complete workflows can additionally be run from a
single YAML configuration, without writing a driver script.

MRManalyzeR starts where the vendor software finishes. It does **not** perform
chromatographic peak detection, peak integration or calibration-curve fitting
from raw mass-spectrometry data.

## Scope

Built for **targeted quantitative assays** — methods of roughly 30 MRM
transitions upward, where the analytes are known compounds carrying pathway
or class annotation, and the experiment is designed to test a hypothesis
rather than to discover features.

Two consequences follow, and they are deliberate:

* **Quantification is internal-standard based.** Normalisation and batch
  correction are therefore intentionally limited — an IS-corrected targeted
  panel does not need, and can be harmed by, the aggressive signal-drift
  modelling that untargeted workflows rely on.
* **Feature metadata carries biology.** Compound class and enzymatic pathway
  are first-class: they group and colour heatmap annotations, PCA loadings
  and correlation blocks throughout.

The primary input is TargetLynx. Skyline exports and plain sample-by-analyte
matrices from any other software are supported through the same workflow, and
the metadata schema is configurable for other laboratories.

### Where MRManalyzeR fits

| Task | Tool |
|---|---|
| Raw untargeted LC-MS feature detection and alignment | `xcms` |
| General metabolomics peak-matrix preprocessing | `pmp` |
| Metabolite annotation-table workflows | `MetMashR` |
| Targeted assay processing, QC and reporting | **MRManalyzeR** |

## Installation

### Bioconductor dependency (do this first)

MRManalyzeR depends on `struct`, which is distributed through Bioconductor
rather than CRAN, so install it with `BiocManager` before installing
MRManalyzeR from GitHub:

```r
if(!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("struct")
```

(`structToolbox` and `pmp` are **not** required. Earlier versions of this
README listed them; they are no longer used.)

### Latest release

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("MJS-708/MRManalyzeR", ref = "main")
```

Development branch:

```r
remotes::install_github("MJS-708/MRManalyzeR", ref = "dev")
```

Local install (from a cloned working copy):

```r
devtools::install("path/to/MRManalyzeR")
```

---

## Quick start — bundled example

Run the workflow against a small bundled oxylipin dataset to verify the
install and produce both reports. No paths to configure:

```r
res <- MRManalyzeR::run_example()
res$output_directory   # where the xlsx + html reports were written
res$datasetExperiment  # the processed dataset
res$stats_tables       # comparisons, correlations, linear models
```

`run_example()` copies the bundled YAML, points it at
`inst/extdata/example_data.xlsx` and a fresh `tempdir()`, runs
`run_MRManalyzeR()`, and (in interactive sessions) opens the rendered
HTML reports in the RStudio viewer / default browser.

### The returned object

Every entry point returns a list whose `datasetExperiment` element is a
`struct::DatasetExperiment` holding four aligned pieces:

| Slot | Contents |
|---|---|
| `data` | the sample × feature matrix, in the reported datatype |
| `sample_meta` | one row per injection, plus everything the YAML added |
| `variable_meta` | one row per compound: class, pathway, CV metrics, exclusion reasons |
| `name` / `description` | provenance carried through to the reports |

Because it is a `DatasetExperiment`, the result drops straight into other
Bioconductor tooling rather than being a private format.

### Example dataset

A subset of the BAL fluid oxylipin panel from **Kolmert *et al.* (2018),
*Prostaglandins & Other Lipid Mediators* 137, 11–18.**
DOI: <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2018.05.005>.

The bundled xlsx (`inst/extdata/example_data.xlsx`) contains a
TargetLynx-style workbook with `feature_metadata`, `sample_metadata` and
`lcms_data_*` sheets; the bundled YAML (`inst/extdata/example_config.yml`)
is annotated and ready to copy as a starting point for your own studies.

A fully synthetic two-batch dataset (`example_synthetic.RDS`) is also
bundled, and is what every function's `@examples` block runs on.

---

## Step-by-step API

The YAML route below is a convenience layer over exported functions. Any
step can be called directly on a `DatasetExperiment`:

```r
library(MRManalyzeR)

de <- assemble_dataset(read_targetlynx("study.xlsx", datatype = "Area"),
                       feature_meta, sample_meta)
de <- filter_blanks(de)
de <- normalise_matrix(de, column = "protein_mg")
de <- impute_missing(de, scalar = 0.2)
de <- correct_batch(de, batch_head = "Chrom_Batch")

qc  <- add_cv_metrics(de)
pca <- run_pca(de, transform = "log2", scale = TRUE)
plot_pca(pca, de, colour_by = "Treatment")
```

See `vignette("MRManalyzeR")` for the full walkthrough, and `?MRManalyzeR`
for the four stages the functions are grouped into: **data parse →
peak-matrix processing → QC check → stats**.

## Usage on your own data

### Step 1 — prepare the data xlsx

The input workbook needs at least three sheets (all sheet names are
configurable):

* **`feature_metadata`** — one row per compound. Required: `Processing_name`
  (the vendor's identifier, used to join to the source table) and `Compound`
  (display name). Optional `Report` column, `YES` / `NO`, indicating whether
  the feature passed prior chromatographic review in TargetLynx or Skyline
  and should be included downstream; if the column is absent every feature is
  reported. MRManalyzeR does not itself inspect chromatographic peak shape —
  that judgement stays in the vendor software.
* **`sample_metadata`** — one row per acquisition. The acquisition name must
  match the vendor export exactly. Add any study metadata you want available
  for QC plots and statistics (e.g. `Injection_order`, `Chrom_Batch`, `Sex`,
  `Treatment`, `Sample_type`).
* **`lcms_data_1`** (and optionally `lcms_data_2`, …) — the TargetLynx
  summary table. All `lcms_data_*` sheets must share the same feature set.
  Skyline and generic-matrix inputs use their own sheets instead.

### Step 2 — copy and edit the YAML template

```r
file.copy(
  system.file("extdata", "example_config.yml", package = "MRManalyzeR"),
  "config.yml"
)
```

Then edit `config.yml`. The key blocks are:

| Block | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `paths:` | input xlsx location, output directory, output filename stem |
| `PeakMatrixProcessing:` | data source and datatype, signal / blank / MV filters, normalisation, IS and volume adjustment, batch correction |
| `data_quality_report:` | per-compound measurement vs injection order, Q-Q normality, QC PCA |
| `stats_report:` | configured group comparisons and multigroup tests, boxplots, correlations, linear models, PCA, volcano, ion ratios, heatmaps |

The statistical method is chosen explicitly per comparison (`welch`,
`student`, `wilcoxon` for two groups; `anova` or `kruskal` for three or
more) — nothing is selected automatically on your behalf.

Every option is documented inline in the bundled YAML — read it once
before editing.

### Step 3 — run

```r
res <- MRManalyzeR::run_MRManalyzeR("config.yml")
```

This writes, into `paths.result_dir`:

* `<fn>_<datatype><suffix>.xlsx` — processed matrix, feature metadata and
  sample metadata
* `<fn>_<datatype><suffix>_stats.xlsx` — a `key` sheet defining every column,
  then `stats`, `correlations`, `linear_models`, `ion_ratios` and `summary`
* `<fn>_<datatype><suffix>_data_quality_report.html`
* `<fn>_<datatype><suffix>_stats_report.html`
* `<fn>_<datatype><suffix>.RDS` and `.txt` — the dataset and the resolved
  parameters

The bundled config sets `suffix: _`, which is why the shipped examples read
`example_data_ng_mL__stats.xlsx` with two underscores. Set `suffix: ""` for
single ones.

To re-render reports from an already-processed RDS (skipping the xlsx
ingest), set `PeakMatrixProcessing.execute: False` and re-run — `fn`,
`datatype` and `suffix` must then match the stored file.

## Combining multiple acquisitions

To merge separately-acquired panels (e.g. GOM, cysLT, SPM, or PL-pos /
PL-neg / SL) sharing biological samples, use the combine workflow:

```r
file.copy(
  system.file("extdata", "example_combine_config.yml", package = "MRManalyzeR"),
  "combine_config.yml"
)
res <- MRManalyzeR::run_MRManalyzeR_combine("combine_config.yml")
```

The combine YAML lists per-panel paths (`.RDS` or `.xlsx`), optional QC
remappings (e.g. SL `QC1..5` ↔ PL `QC1, QC2, QC5, QC7, QC8`), feature
prefixing, and the same `stats_report:` block as a regular run.
`PeakMatrixProcessing` and the data quality report are skipped — the
inputs are already-processed matrices.

---

## Reports

Both reports are self-contained HTML with tabset navigation and (by
default) plotly hover tooltips that surface `Sample_ID` on points and
boxplot jitter. Toggle off with `interactive_plots: False` in either
report block of the YAML.

| Report | Sections |
|---|---|
| `data_quality_report` | sample summary; per-compound measurement vs injection order, in the selected datatype; per-compound Q-Q normality; QC PCA (one tab per colouring) |
| `stats_report` | global summaries; per-comparison statistical tables; per-compound boxplots (faceted across comparisons + by free-form factor); per-comparison PCA (scores + loadings); volcano; ion ratios (e.g. EpOME/DiHOME for sEH activity); samples × features heatmap; correlations; linear models |

Every figure in both reports is drawn by an exported `plot_*()` function, so
any panel can be reproduced, restyled or subset in one line without editing
an R Markdown file.

# Tests for filterFeatures() / filterSamples().
#
# The arithmetic is deliberately native rather than delegated to pmp: the
# calculation is a column mean of !is.na, MRManalyzeR's matrices are
# samples-in-rows where pmp wants features-in-rows, and a runtime dependency
# for that is not worth the transpose. pmp is used here instead as an ORACLE -
# the last test asserts the two agree, so the claim "matches
# pmp::filter_peaks_by_fraction" is checked rather than asserted.

# npOnly is the case the whole design exists for: absent from Control, present
# throughout NP. 'within' must keep it and 'across' must not.

#' MRManalyzeR: targeted LC-MS lipidomics and metabolomics processing
#'
#' Processes and analyses targeted lipidomics and metabolomics data exported from
#' Waters TargetLynx or Skyline: builds a peak-area / concentration matrix with
#' signal-to-noise or LOD/LOQ filtering, blank filtering, normalisation,
#' calibration/internal-standard concentration adjustment, missing-value
#' imputation and batch correction, then runs the statistical analyses and
#' renders two self-contained HTML reports.
#'
#' The workflow falls into four stages. Everything from stage 1 onwards is
#' carried in a single `struct::DatasetExperiment`, so each function takes that
#' object and returns it.
#'
#' @section Entry points:
#' [run_MRManalyzeR()] drives all four stages from a single YAML config;
#' [run_MRManalyzeR_combine()] merges several acquisition panels into one
#' analysis; [run_example()] runs the bundled example dataset end to end.
#'
#' @section 1. Data parse:
#' What did the instrument report? [read_targetlynx()] and [read_skyline()]
#' read a workbook into a wide sample x compound matrix, which
#' [assemble_dataset()] turns into a `struct::DatasetExperiment`.
#' [load_config()], [load_dataset()] and [combine_datasets()] read a YAML
#' config, a stored dataset, and several datasets merged into one.
#'
#' @section 2. Peak-matrix processing:
#' What is the true concentration? [filter_blanks()], [normalise_matrix()],
#' [adjust_concentration()], [impute_missing()] and [correct_batch()], with
#' [subset_dataset()] to slice a dataset by sample metadata.
#' [process_dataset()] composes stages 1 and 2 in one call.
#'
#' @section 3. QC check:
#' Can these numbers be trusted? [run_pca()], plus the per-compound CV metrics
#' added to `variable_meta` by [run_MRManalyzeR()] and the bundled
#' data-quality report.
#'
#' @section 4. Stats:
#' What do these numbers mean? [run_stats()] runs the comparisons,
#' correlations and linear models described by the YAML `stats_report:` block
#' and returns the same tables the statistics report and the output xlsx use.
#'
#' The `plot_*()` functions are exported rather than hidden inside the report
#' templates so that a figure can be reproduced, restyled or subset in one
#' line, without editing an R Markdown file or rebuilding it from the matrix.
#' The bundled reports call the same functions.
#'
#' See `vignette("MRManalyzeR")` for a step-by-step walkthrough.

#' Resolve a configured metadata column name against the stored names
#'
#' `struct::DatasetExperiment` runs `make.names()` over the metadata it is
#' handed, so a column headed `S-group` in the source workbook is stored as
#' `S.group`, and `pubchem/KEGG_id` as `pubchem.KEGG_id`. A config naming the
#' original then matches nothing, and a plot that colours by it falls back to
#' no colouring at all - which is how a hyphen in a spreadsheet heading turns
#' into a missing legend with no error anywhere.
#'
#' Try the name exactly as written first, so a workbook that genuinely has
#' both `S-group` and `S.group` is not silently redirected, then its
#' `make.names()` form.
#'
#' @param name Column name from the config, or `NULL`.
#' @param df Data frame whose columns are being matched.
#' @return The matching column name, or `NULL` if neither form is present.

#' than depended on because `ltc` is distributed only on GitHub, and a
#' Bioconductor package cannot require a remote install.

  # appear once a variable has more than five levels. A two- or three-level
  # factor should not be drawn in two shades of amber.
  #
  # The off-shades are ordered so each sits as far as possible from the strong
  # hue it resembles: teal, then crimson (5 places after red), light green (5
  # after green) and orange (5 after yellow), so no legend pairs yellow with
  # orange until it has nine levels.

  # ltc's black is replaced by a mid grey and moved last. Black reads as a
  # rule or an axis rather than as a category, and it dominates a heatmap
  # annotation strip; grey recedes, which is what a ninth-most-important
  # level should do. It is darker than the grey70 used for NA in
  # .group_fill_colors(), so a real level is never confused with a missing one.

#' Filter features by detection frequency
#'
#' Drops features that are missing from too much of the data. A feature's
#' detection fraction is the proportion of samples in which it has a non-`NA`
#' value; `method` decides which samples that proportion is computed over.
#'
#' `"across"` pools every study sample into one fraction. It is the strictest
#' option and the easiest to misuse: a feature present throughout one treatment
#' group and absent from the others scores roughly `1 / n_groups`, so a
#' threshold of 0.5 deletes it *because* it is treatment-specific. Use it only
#' when the question is "is this measured everywhere".
#'
#' `"within"` (the default) computes the fraction separately within each level
#' of `group_col` and keeps a feature that clears `min_frac` in **any one**
#' level, so the treatment-specific feature above survives on its own group.
#' Small groups quantise the threshold: with `n = 3` a fraction can only be 0,
#' 1/3, 2/3 or 1, so every `min_frac` in (1/3, 2/3] behaves identically.
#'
#' `"QC"` computes the fraction over QC injections only, which answers "is this
#' measured reproducibly" rather than "is this present in the biology". QCs are
#' pooled, so a feature confined to one treatment is diluted in the pool and can
#' fall below detection there - this mode also removes treatment-specific
#' features. With no QCs present the function warns and falls back.
#'
#' QC and blank injections never count towards `"within"` or `"across"`. They
#' remain in the returned dataset, since the blank filter and [correctBatch()]
#' still need them, but they are excluded from the denominator so a compound
#' seen only in the QCs cannot keep itself alive.
#'
#' The fraction actually used is recorded per feature in `variable_meta` as
#' `detected_frac`, so the decision is inspectable rather than only visible as
#' absent columns.
#'
#' @param de A `struct::DatasetExperiment`.
#' @param min_frac Numeric in `[0, 1]`. A feature is kept when its detection
#'   fraction is greater than or equal to this.
#' @param method `"within"` (default), `"across"` or `"QC"`; see Details.
#' @param group_col `sample_meta` column whose levels are tested separately
#'   when `method = "within"`. Required for that method.
#' @param sample_col `sample_meta` column identifying the sample type.
#' @param sample_labels Values of `sample_col` marking study samples. Only
#'   these count towards `"within"` and `"across"`.
#' @param qc_label Value of `sample_col` marking QC injections, used by
#'   `method = "QC"`.
#' @return `de` with failing features removed from `data` and `variable_meta`,
#'   and a `detected_frac` column added to `variable_meta`.
#' @family peak-matrix processing
#' @seealso [filterSamples()], which drops injections rather than features and
#'   is meant to run after this one.

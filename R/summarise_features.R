#' Summarise which compounds were reported and which were dropped
#'
#' Returns one row per compound the run started with, marking whether it
#' survived into the reported matrix and why not if it did not. Exclusions
#' accumulate from several places - signal-to-noise or LOD/LOQ masking that
#' left a feature entirely missing, features whose `Processing_name` had no
#' rows in the source data, and source columns with no `feature_metadata` entry
#' - so the reason recorded in `Comment` is often the only trace of what
#' happened to a compound.
#'
#' This is the table the data-quality report shows as "compounds included" and
#' "compounds excluded"; keeping it as one frame with a `Status` column makes
#' it sortable and searchable in one place, and writable to a single sheet.
#'
#' @param de A `struct::DatasetExperiment` - the reported dataset.
#' @param removed_features Optional data frame of dropped features, as returned
#'   in `[[2]]` by [process_dataset()]. `NULL` (or zero rows) yields an
#'   included-only table, which is what happens when a run reuses a stored RDS
#'   rather than reprocessing.
#' @return A data frame with columns `Compound`, `Status` (`"included"` /
#'   `"excluded"`) and `Comment`.

#' Append/replace stats sheets in the results xlsx

#'   \item `stats`         - long table of comparisons + post-hoc.
#'   \item `correlations`  - long table of feature x feature correlations.
#'   \item `linear_models` - long table of `lm()` coefficients.
#'   \item `ion_ratios`    - per-sample ion ratios with their group test.
#'   \item `summary`       - n / mean / SD / SE per group per compound.
#'   \item `cor_<name>_<subset>_<method>` - one wide correlation matrix tab
#'         per (correlation x subset x method). Sheet names are sanitised
#'         and truncated to 31 characters (Excel limit).
#' }
#' If the workbook does not exist (e.g. results dir was cleaned), a new one

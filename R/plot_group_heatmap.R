#' Group-mean heatmap that shows which samples produced the mean
#'
#' The same picture [plotHeatmap()] draws - compounds on rows, samples on
#' columns, a coloured annotation bar for the sample factor along the top and
#' for the compound class down the left, gaps between blocks - with one thing
#' changed: what a cell's colour means. The **hue** is the group's mean scaled
#' value, and the **opacity** of each sample's cell is how much that sample
#' contributed to it.
#'
#' A block that is uniformly solid is an effect the whole group shares. A block
#' carrying one opaque cell among faded ones is a mean resting on a single
#' sample - which is what a plain group-mean heatmap hides, and what a reader
#' needs in order to judge whether a colour contrast is worth believing.
#'
#' [plotHeatmap()] never averages, so it does not have this problem, and it is
#' the better choice while the sample axis stays legible - in practice, while
#' there are two groups. Past three the cells get narrow and the eye stops
#' resolving individual samples anyway, which is where this earns its place.
#'
#' @section How a cell is built:
#' Values are transformed, then scaled per compound across **all** samples, so
#' a cell reads "high or low for this compound" rather than "abundant or not".
#' Rows are therefore not comparable to each other in absolute terms.
#'
#' The hue is the mean of those scores within a group. The opacity is the
#' sample's own score multiplied by the sign of its group mean, so a sample
#' that moved with its group is opaque and one that sat near zero, or pulled
#' the other way, fades. `alpha_floor` stops a non-contributing sample becoming
#' invisible and reading as missing data; genuinely missing values are drawn in
#' `na.value` grey at full opacity, so the two cannot be confused.
#'
#' Note that "contributed" is measured against the mean of **all** samples, not
#' against the group's own members, so it is not the same as "has the largest
#' value". A group of four holding one very high sample and three low ones has
#' a *negative* mean if the three sit further from the overall centre than the
#' one sits above it - and then the three are what produced that mean, and the
#' high sample is the one opposing it and fading out. The opacity answers "did
#' this sample push its group where the group ended up", not "is this sample
#' large".
#'
#' @section Choosing the colour limit:
#' `cap` defaults to a quantile of the group means actually being drawn, and
#' that default matters more than it looks. Averaging *n* replicates shrinks a
#' scaled value by roughly `sqrt(n)`, so a limit chosen for per-sample scores -
#' the `+/-2.5` that suits [plotHeatmap()] - leaves a group-mean panel using a
#' small part of the colour range and looking washed out, whatever the opacity
#' is set to. Take the limit from the quantity being drawn.
#'
#' @param de A `struct::DatasetExperiment`.
#' @param color_samples_by `sample_meta` column defining the groups to average
#'   within, and the annotation bar along the top. Named to match
#'   [plotHeatmap()], where it does the annotation half of the same job.
#' @param features Compounds to include; `NULL` uses all of them.
#' @param group_features_by `variable_meta` column used to block compounds and
#'   colour the annotation bar down the left; `NULL` leaves them unblocked.
#' @param transform `"none"`, `"log2"` or `"sqrt"`, applied before scaling.
#'   Negative values are floored at 0 first.
#' @param cap Colour limit, in standard deviations of the group means. `NULL`
#'   takes the 97th percentile of `abs()` of the group means, so a few cells
#'   saturate and the rest get the full range.
#' @param alpha_floor Opacity given to a sample that did not contribute to its
#'   group's mean. Below about 0.4 those cells read as missing data.
#' @param feature_labels `"show"`, `"small"` or `"hide"`.
#' @param sample_labels Draw the sample axis. `FALSE` for wide cohorts, where
#'   the samples stay individually visible but not individually named.
#' @param sample_id_head `sample_meta` column supplying sample labels; `NULL`
#'   uses row names.
#' @param title Plot title.
#' @return A `ggplot`, or `NULL` when there is too little data to draw (fewer
#'   than 2 samples, or fewer than 2 compounds with any variance).

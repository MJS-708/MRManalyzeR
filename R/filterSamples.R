#' Filter injections by missing-value fraction
#'
#' Drops study samples in which too large a proportion of features is `NA`.
#' Where [filterFeatures()] asks a question about the biology, this asks one
#' about the run: an injection that missed most of the panel is usually a
#' failure rather than a finding.
#'
#' **Run this after [filterFeatures()], not before.** Judging an injection
#' against a feature list that still contains everything the instrument barely
#' saw gives a meaningless denominator - every sample looks poor because the
#' feature set is padded with noise. Once the undetected features are gone, the
#' fraction answers the question worth asking: of the features that are real,
#' how many did this injection get?
#'
#' **Only study samples are eligible for removal.** A QC or blank that fails the
#' threshold is reported but kept, because dropping a QC can leave a batch
#' without one and [correctBatch()] would then have nothing to anchor to. If a
#' QC really did fail, exclude it deliberately in the sample metadata rather
#' than letting a threshold do it silently.
#'
#' The fraction computed for every row is recorded in `sample_meta` as
#' `na_frac`, including for the QCs and blanks that were exempt, so a failing
#' QC is visible afterwards.
#'
#' @param de A `struct::DatasetExperiment`.
#' @param max_na Numeric in `[0, 1]`. A study sample is dropped when the
#'   proportion of `NA` features exceeds this.
#' @param sample_col `sample_meta` column identifying the sample type.
#' @param sample_labels Values of `sample_col` marking study samples - the only
#'   rows this function will remove.
#' @return `de` with failing study samples removed from `data` and
#'   `sample_meta`, and an `na_frac` column added to `sample_meta`.
#' @family peak-matrix processing
#' @seealso [filterFeatures()], which should run first.

# Build the synthetic example dataset

#   inst/extdata/example_synthetic.RDS   - the processed DatasetExperiment
#
# NOTHING HERE IS REAL DATA. Every value is simulated from a fixed seed. The
# bundled TargetLynx workbook (example_data.xlsx) is the real dataset; this one
# exists because that one cannot exercise the whole workflow: it is a single
# chromatographic batch, one reconstitution volume for every vial, and has no
# per-sample amount to normalise to, so normalise_matrix(), correct_batch() and
# adjust_concentration() would all be no-ops on it.
#
# What is deliberately planted, so the documentation can show each step
# recovering something known:
#
#   * a TREATMENT EFFECT on 5 of the 20 analytes (recorded in
#     feature_metadata$Simulated_log2FC; the other 15 are flat), so the stats
#     stage can be checked against the truth;
#   * a per-analyte RESPONSE SHIFT between the two chromatographic batches,
#     so correct_batch() has something to remove and a PCA coloured by batch
#     separates before correction and not after;
#   * QC injections drawn with ~8 percent noise against ~35 percent between
#     animals, so CV_QC, CV_sample and their ratio are realistic;
#   * signal proportional to protein_ug (divided out by normalise_matrix) and
#     inversely proportional to the reconstitution volume, which differs
#     between batches;
#   * a per-analyte LOD that masks the bottom of each distribution, with two
#     analytes deliberately sparse.
#
# The design is BALANCED ACROSS BATCHES (5 animals per treatment x genotype
# cell in each batch) - otherwise the batch effect and the treatment effect
# would be confounded and neither could be demonstrated.
#
# Run from the package root, after devtools::load_all():
#   source("data-raw/make_example_synthetic.R")
